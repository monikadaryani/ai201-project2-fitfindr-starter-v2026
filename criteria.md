# Acceptance criteria — FitFindr

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this agent, written in unit 3
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. *"The agent handles errors"* is an opinion.
*"When search returns nothing, the agent stops before calling the second tool,
in 5 of 5 tries"* is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter one. A reason that says something about your tools, your loop, or the
data earns credit; *"80% seemed reasonable"* does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

**Two are written for you. You write three.**

## 1. A matching query completes all three tools

Given a query that matches at least one listing, the agent completes all three
tool calls and returns a fit card — in at least 4 of 5 tries.

**Why this target:**
<!-- Why 4 of 5 and not 5 of 5? Something about your search, probably —
     "my search is a plain keyword match and some phrasings will miss" is a
     real answer. -->

If some keywords are missed because we are using regex, we can expect the tool to miss occasionally.

---

## 2. An impossible query stops before the second tool

Given a query that matches no listings, the agent stops before calling
`suggest_outfit` and returns a message naming what to change — 5 of 5 tries.

**Why this target:**
<!-- Why is 5 of 5 reasonable here when criterion 1 isn't? What's different
     about this path? -->
We have explicitly said that if no listing is received, it should stop before `suggest_outfit`, so this path should follow that rule.

---

## 3. Something about state

<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE.

     How would you know that the item your search found is the same item the
     next tool received? Name something countable or observable.

     This is the criterion people find hardest, because state failure doesn't
     look like state failure — it looks like a tool problem. Something that
     compares session["selected_item"] against what actually reached
     suggest_outfit is the shape you're after. -->

For 5 of 5 tries, the listing chosen by the search is the same item stored in `session["selected_item"]`, the same item passed into `suggest_outfit`, and the same item referenced in the fit card.

**Why this target:**
This is a direct state-check, not a vague quality judgment. If the agent changes items between tools, the system can still produce a polished response while recommending the wrong product. The test is observable and countable: the same listing identifier or title must flow through each step.

## 4. Something about the fit card

<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE.

     The fit card calls a model, so the same input can produce different words
     each time. That's not a bug — it's the nature of the tool. So what would
     make it acceptable?

     Think about what you'd actually be unhappy to see. A caption that never
     mentions the price? Two different items producing the same opening
     sentence? A card longer than a caption anyone would post? Any of those can
     be turned into a number. -->

For at least 4 of 5 tries, the fit card includes the item’s title or a unique listing name and the sale price, and the card remains 2–4 sentences long.

**Why this target:**
The model is allowed to vary its wording, so the criterion should not require identical phrasing. What matters is that the final card still contains the item identity and the numeric price, because those are the parts users need to decide whether the recommendation is worth it.

---

## 5. Your choice

<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE TOO.

     Pick something you actually care about getting right. Speed, the empty
     wardrobe path, what happens when the model can't be reached, whether the
     search respects a price ceiling — anything, as long as it names a number
     or an observable outcome. -->

When the user provides a size or a maximum price, the selected listing must match that size and cost no more than the stated limit in 5 of 5 tries. If only one constraint is provided, only that one is checked.

**Why this target:**
This is a core user-value check. The tool is not useful if it writes a stylish caption for an item that ignores the user’s budget or size, even when the rest of the workflow appears successful. The rule is simple, measurable, and easy to grade without subjective interpretation.

     UNIT 4 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 4. Something about the fit card

         The fit card is different every time.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 4:** For 5 different items, the 5 fit cards share
         > no opening sentence.
         >
         > **Why revised:** "different" wasn't checkable — two cards that
         > differed by one word still counted. The new version is something I
         > can actually score.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said the empty search stops it 5 of 5 times, but I got 3 of 5,
            so 3 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.
